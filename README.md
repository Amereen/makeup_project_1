# Project-1-Makeup
The project's primary objective was to develop an engaging and simple app platform for enhancing women's cosmetic experiences and access to inexpensive cosmetics.
## Usage
In my app I have included a like button '♥'. You can heart any product you love and it will state 'liked!'

Additionally, I've added a drop-down category selector which will allow you to navigate directly to the cosemtic product you would like to see.

 ## Hidden Feautures
If you hover your cursor over any product image, a complete product description will appear. The description will disappear as you move your cursor away from the product image.
